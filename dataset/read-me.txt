This folder has six fastq. files subsetted from the dataset SRR2889880.fastq.gz to reduce size. We generated six files, each with about 7M reads.
The folder also has the fasta file for the E. coli ATCC 25922 genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000743255.1/). 
The reference paper for this assembly can be found here: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/genomea.00969-14.
