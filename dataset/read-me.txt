This folder contains six fastq files, subsetted from the dataset SRR2889880.fastq.gz to reduce file size. We generated six files, each with about 7M reads.
The folder also contains the FASTA file for the E. coli ATCC 25922 genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000743255.1/) and the annotation file (GFF format). 
The reference paper for this assembly can be found here: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/genomea.00969-14.
