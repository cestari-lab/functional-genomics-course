This folder contains the genome files that we will use for in-class analysis.

1) The folder contains the FASTA file for the E. coli ATCC 25922 genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000743255.1/) and the annotation file (GFF format). 
The reference paper for this assembly can be found here (Minogue et al. 2014, Genome Announcements): https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/genomea.00969-14. 
There are also seven fastq files related to the E.coli genome. We subsetted from the dataset SRR2889880.fastq.gz to reduce file size, each with about 7M reads, and one at 2M reads (not in this folder, we will share this with you in class). 
2) We also have two genome versions of the Trypanosoma cruzi Sylvio strain, assembled in 2018 (Talavera-Lopez et al. 2021, Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol.) and in 2025 (Cruz-Saavedra et al. 2025, Nature Communications), for comparison. 
3) We also have the Trypanosoma brucei genome (Muller et al. 2018, Nature). We will use this genome for Hi-C analysis. We will use a subset of Hi-C data from Antunes et al. 2025, Nature Communications (data will be provided in class).
